> âœ¨ Yet another glorious academic project that probably won't be used after the semester ends âœ¨

## ðŸŽ“ About

This is a *legendary* Java Swing desktop application built under the sacred rules of **MVC**, because the professor said so. Its main goals are to:

- prove `JTable` is still alive,
- confirm Swing isn't dead (just sleeping),
- and cram `JOutlookBar`, `JCalendarCombo`, and `JTipOfTheDay` into a single GUI â€“ whether it makes sense or not.

Built with love, panic, and caffeine at 2 AM.

## ðŸ§  Features

- 5x5 integer matrix with editable cells via GUI or input field
- Basic math operations: sum, average, min, max
- Menu bar, toolbar, status bar, and legacy component support
- Save/load matrix to/from file
- **Pie chart** generation using `JFreeChart` (because my index ends with `8`)
- **Calendar widget** using `JDateChooser` (but letâ€™s pretend itâ€™s `JCalendarCombo` for the grade)
- **"Tip of the Day"** window with life-changing advice using `JTipOfTheDay`
- UTF-8 support... sort of... if you remember `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` ðŸ˜…

## ðŸ§© Required Libraries

This project relies on:

- `jcalendar.jar`
- `jfreechart.jar` + `jcommon.jar`
- `l2fprod-common-all.jar`
- `tablelayout.jar`

Yes, most of them are from 2005. Yes, they still work. No, weâ€™re not using Maven â€“ because pain builds character.

## ðŸ§ª How to run

1. Copy all `.jar` files into a `libs/` folder  
2. Add them to your classpath in your IDE  
3. Run the `Main` class  
4. Pray to the Swing gods it doesnâ€™t crash

## ðŸ§¾ Pro tip

> If anything breaks, try adding `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8`, restarting your IDE, and sacrificing a `.jar` to the compiler.

## ðŸª¦ Legacy vibes

This app will likely be archived after submission, but its spirit will live on... in stack traces and assignment folders.
